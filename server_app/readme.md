## Websocket Server using Python
This feature is optional, I made it because I wanted to control the web app remotely using a remote made on ESP32 Wifi Microcontroller with a websocket client backend.
This websocket server is running on Python. So you need to install 'websockets' package on your Python environment.  
<code>pip install websockets</code>  
You can compile the python code to an executable file for Windows using <code>'auto-py-to-exe'</code>  
then it will be a lot easier to handle or execute the file with PHP <code>exec()</code> and run the websocket server in the backend.  
It would be helpful if you were running this app for a kiosk booth or a photobooth.
